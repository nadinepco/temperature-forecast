# temperature-forecast

Using [ECAD Temperature data](www.ecad.eu), this project's goal is to create a short term temperature forecast using AR model.

### Process:
1. Get and clean temperature data from www.ecad.eu
2. Build a baseline model modelling trend and seasonality
3. Plot and inspect the different components of a time series
4. Model time dependence of the remainder using an AR model
5. Compare the statistical output of different AR models
6. Test the remainder for stationarity
